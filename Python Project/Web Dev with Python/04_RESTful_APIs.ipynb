    "# RESTful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are web services that follow REST principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## REST Principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n",
    "- No session state is stored on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Client-Server\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear separation between client and server.\n",
    "- Client handles user interface, server handles data storage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Uniform Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "- All resources are accessed through a uniform interface.\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Cacheable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not.\n",
    "- Improves performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Layered System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client cannot tell if it's connected directly to the server or through intermediaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Code on Demand (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP Methods in REST:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GET**: Retrieve data from a resource\n",
    "- **POST**: Create a new resource\n",
    "- **PUT**: Update an existing resource\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Remove a resource\n",
    "- **PATCH**: Partially update a resource\n",

    "# Authentication and Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is crucial for web APIs. Authentication verifies identity, while authorization determines permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Basic Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "- Username and password sent in Authorization header\n",
    "- Base64 encoded: `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`\n",
    "- Simple but not very secure (should use HTTPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique key provided to each client\n",
    "- Sent in header, query parameter, or request body\n",
    "- Simple to implement but can be compromised\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bearer Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "- Token-based authentication\n",
    "- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`\n",
    "- Often used with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. OAuth 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authorization framework for delegated access\n",
    "- Involves authorization server, resource owner, client, and resource server\n",
    "- Grant types: Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner Password, Client Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. JWT (JSON Web Tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims\n",
    "- Consists of header, payload, and signature\n",
    "- Can be used for authentication and information exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authorization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions based on user roles\n",
    "- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Permissions based on attributes\n",
    "- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Permissions defined per resource\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use HTTPS\n",
    "- Implement rate limiting\n",
    "- Validate and sanitize inputs\n",
    "- Use secure token storage\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling (don't leak sensitive information)\n",
    "- Regularly rotate keys and tokens\n",
    "- Use HTTPS-only cookies for web applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Security Headers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `X-API-Key`: For API key authentication\n",
    "- `Authorization`: For Bearer tokens\n",
    "- `WWW-Authenticate`: For authentication challenges\n",
    "- `X-Rate-Limit-*`: For rate limiting information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Token Expiration and Refresh:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access tokens should have short lifetimes\n",
    "- Use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens\n",
    "- Implement token revocation mechanisms\n"

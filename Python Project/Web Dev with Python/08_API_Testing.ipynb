    "# API Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "API testing ensures that APIs work correctly, perform well, and are secure. It involves testing the API endpoints, data formats, and business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of API Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Functional Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests API functionality against requirements\n",
    "- Verifies correct responses for valid requests\n",
    "- Checks error handling for invalid requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Load Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests API performance under load\n",
    "- Measures response times and throughput\n",
    "- Identifies bottlenecks and scalability issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Security Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests authentication and authorization\n",
    "- Checks for vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)\n",
    "- Validates data encryption and secure transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Integration Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tests API interactions with other systems\n",
    "- Verifies data flow between components\n",
    "- Checks third-party API integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Regression Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures new changes don't break existing functionality\n",
    "- Runs after code updates or deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Testing Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Postman**: GUI tool for API testing and documentation\n",
    "- **Insomnia**: REST client for API testing\n",
    "- **curl**: Command-line tool for HTTP requests\n",
    "- **pytest** (Python): Framework for API testing\n",
    "- **Rest-Assured** (Java): DSL for REST API testing\n",
    "- **Newman**: Command-line runner for Postman collections\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test individual API endpoints\n",
    "- Mock external dependencies\n",
    "- Focus on business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test API with real databases and services\n",
    "- Verify end-to-end functionality\n",
    "- Test data persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contract Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define API contracts between services\n",
    "- Ensure API changes don't break consumers\n",
    "- Use tools like Pact or Spring Cloud Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Cases Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive Tests**: Valid requests with expected responses\n",
    "- **Negative Tests**: Invalid requests with proper error responses\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Boundary values, empty inputs, large payloads\n",
    "- **Security Tests**: Unauthorized access, malformed tokens\n",
    "- **Performance Tests**: Response times under load\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automate tests**: Use CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "- **Test all HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH\n",
    "- **Test status codes**: Verify correct HTTP status codes\n",
    "- **Validate response format**: Check JSON/XML structure\n",
    "- **Test pagination**: For list endpoints\n",
    "- **Test rate limiting**: Ensure proper throttling\n",
    "- **Document tests**: Keep test cases documented\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python API Testing Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_get_users():\n",
    "    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 200\n",
    "    assert isinstance(response.json(), list)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_create_user():\n",
    "    user_data = {'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'}\n",
    "    response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/users', json=user_data)\n",
    "    assert response.status_code == 201\n",
    "    assert response.json()['name'] == 'John'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mocking and Stubbing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mocking**: Simulate external dependencies\n",
    "- **Stubbing**: Provide canned responses for testing\n",
    "- **Tools**: unittest.mock, responses, httpretty\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run API tests in CI pipelines\n",
    "- Test against staging environments\n",
    "- Monitor API health and performance\n",
    "- Generate test reports and coverage metrics\n"

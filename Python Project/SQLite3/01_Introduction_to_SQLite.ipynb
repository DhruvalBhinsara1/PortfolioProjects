    "# Introduction to SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It's also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n",

    "In this notebook, you'll learn the basics of SQLite in Python, including importing, basic concepts, and getting started."

    "## Why Use SQLite?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lightweight**: No server required, self-contained database engine\n",
    "- **Zero-configuration**: No setup or administration needed\n",
    "- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS\n",
    "- **Transactional**: ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n",
    "- **Public domain**: Free to use for any purpose\n",
    "- **Embedded**: Can be embedded directly into applications\n",
    "- **Single file**: Entire database stored in a single file"

    "- **Database**: A file containing tables (e.g., 'example.db')\n",
    "- **Table**: A collection of rows and columns\n",
    "- **Row**: A single record in a table\n",
    "- **Column**: A field in the table with a specific data type\n",
    "- **Cursor**: An object used to execute SQL commands and fetch results\n",
    "- **Connection**: An object that represents the database connection"

    "## Data Types in SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports the following data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NULL**: Represents a missing value\n",
    "- **INTEGER**: Signed integer (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes)\n",
    "- **REAL**: Floating-point value (8-byte IEEE floating point)\n",
    "- **TEXT**: Text string (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE)\n",
    "- **BLOB**: Binary data\n",

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- sqlite3 module (built-in with Python)

## Getting Started

1. Start with `01_Introduction_to_SQLite.ipynb` to understand the basics
2. Follow the notebooks in numerical order for a complete learning path
3. Each notebook contains practical examples and code snippets
4. Run the code cells to see SQLite in action

## Key Concepts Covered

- Database connections and cursors
- SQL commands (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Data types and constraints
- Transactions and ACID properties
- Error handling and exceptions
- Security best practices (preventing SQL injection)
- Performance optimization
- Database design principles

## Resources

- [SQLite Official Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
- [Python sqlite3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
- [SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)

## Tips

- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Use transactions for related database operations
- Handle exceptions properly with try-except blocks
- Close database connections when done
- Consider using context managers for automatic resource management
- Create appropriate indexes for better performance
- Regularly backup your databases

Happy learning! ðŸš€

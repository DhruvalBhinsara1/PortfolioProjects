    "\n",
    "- **Web Scraping Ethics**: Always respect website terms of service, robots.txt, and implement rate limiting to avoid overloading servers.\n",
    "- **Robust Data Extraction**: Using multiple fallback selectors ensures reliable data extraction even when website layouts change.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Removing non-ASCII characters and handling encoding issues is crucial for clean, usable data.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Implementing checks for HTTP status codes and graceful failure handling makes scrapers more reliable.\n",
    "- **Data Export**: Pandas makes it easy to structure and export scraped data to CSV for further analysis."
